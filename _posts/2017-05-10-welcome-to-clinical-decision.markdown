We created a [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/clinicaldecision) called clinicaldecision.
You’ll find a link to the group in the footer of each page.

This site is using Jekyll.

If you want to add a post, email your text or send a pull request through ou [GitHub repository](https://github.com/clinicaldecision/clinicaldecision.github.io).
Regular contributors can get write access to the repository.
